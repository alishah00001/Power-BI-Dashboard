# Applied Statistics and Data Visualization Project: Global Population Dynamics

## Project Overview

[cite_start]This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis and visualization of global population dynamics. [cite: 1] [cite_start]Using Power BI Desktop, the project explores population figures, projections, and related demographic indicators across various countries and time periods. [cite: 1] [cite_start]The analysis leverages three primary datasets: "Population Figures & Projections.csv", "Population Figures & Projections Metadata.xlsx", and "Country Groupings.xlsx". [cite: 8, 9, 10, 11]

## Key Analyses and Visualizations Performed

### Data Understanding and Initial Exploration:
* [cite_start]**Population Figures & Projections.csv:** Contains data on population (male and female), population growth (annual %), rural and urban populations, life expectancy, birth rate, and death rate over time. [cite: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
* [cite_start]**Population Figures & Projections Metadata.xlsx:** Provides descriptions, definitions, and units for the columns in the main population dataset. [cite: 22]
* [cite_start]**Country Groupings.xlsx:** Offers a mapping of countries by regions and income groups, enabling comparative analysis across different economies. [cite: 24, 31, 32]
* **Notable Observations:**
    * [cite_start]Detailed population figures, including male and female populations and annual growth rates, allow for identification of growth or decline trends for specific countries and regions. [cite: 27]
    * [cite_start]Urban and rural population data can be used to determine urbanization patterns and shifts in population distribution over time. [cite: 28]
    * [cite_start]Indicators like life expectancy, birth rate, and death rate provide insights into changes in quality of life across countries and regions. [cite: 29, 30]

### Dashboard Objectives and Justification of Visualizations:

[cite_start]The dashboard aims to visualize population trends, urbanization patterns, and health indicators with interactive capabilities. [cite: 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]

1.  [cite_start]**Population Trend (Line and Stacked Column Chart):** [cite: 34, 41]
    * [cite_start]**Purpose:** To highlight total, urban, and rural population differences over time for the top 5 most populated countries. [cite: 34, 42]
    * [cite_start]**Justification:** Bar and column charts are effective for comparing discrete categories, while line charts are ideal for showing temporal trends. [cite: 44, 45, 46] [cite_start]The combination provides a comprehensive view of overall trends and relative distribution. [cite: 48, 49, 50]

2.  [cite_start]**Life Expectancy (Filled Map):** [cite: 37, 51]
    * [cite_start]**Purpose:** To visualize average life expectancy rates across different countries using color intensity. [cite: 37, 52]
    * [cite_start]**Justification:** Humans intuitively interpret maps. [cite: 54] [cite_start]Color intensity serves as a pre-attentive attribute, allowing quick understanding of differences in life expectancy rates. [cite: 55, 56, 57] [cite_start]Provides clear geographical insights with interactive tooltips for detailed information. [cite: 59, 60, 61]

3.  [cite_start]**Urban vs. Rural Population Growth (Stacked Area Chart):** [cite: 35, 62]
    * [cite_start]**Purpose:** To compare urban and rural population trends over time and identify urbanization patterns. [cite: 35, 63, 69]
    * [cite_start]**Justification:** Stacked area charts allow viewing multiple components within one view, highlighting individual trends and their contribution to the total over time, using different colors for clarity. [cite: 65, 66, 68, 70]

4.  [cite_start]**Natural Increase Rate (Card):** [cite: 38, 71]
    * [cite_start]**Purpose:** To prominently display the average natural increase rate as a key performance indicator (KPI). [cite: 38, 72, 77]
    * [cite_start]**Justification:** Cards minimize visual clutter and isolate a specific value, making it a focal point for the viewer. [cite: 74, 75]

5.  [cite_start]**Birth Rate, Death Rate, and Population Growth (Line Chart):** [cite: 36, 78]
    * [cite_start]**Purpose:** To plot trends of birth rate, annual population growth, and death rate over different periods. [cite: 36, 79]
    * [cite_start]**Justification:** Multiple line charts are highly effective for comparing and showing trends of different variables over time, with distinct colors aiding recognition. [cite: 81, 82] [cite_start]This highlights critical patterns and provides actionable insights. [cite: 84]

### Dashboard Layout, Formatting, and Composition:
* [cite_start]**Layout:** Utilizes a top-to-bottom and left-to-right hierarchy, prioritizing key insights (top 5 countries, life expectancy map) at the top. [cite: 87, 88] [cite_start]Deeper analytics (stacked area chart, line chart) are placed on the bottom left and right. [cite: 89] [cite_start]Interactive filters for Country Name and Year are included for dynamic exploration. [cite: 39, 90]
* [cite_start]**Formatting:** Consistent color coding is used for clear segmentation (e.g., urban vs. rural populations, trend emphasis). [cite: 92, 93] [cite_start]All visuals feature clear titles, legends, and axes, with a consistent font and style throughout. [cite: 94, 95]
* [cite_start]**Composition:** The dashboard effectively uses chart types suited for their purpose (bar for comparison, line for trends, stacked area for breakdown). [cite: 97] [cite_start]The prominent display of the "natural increase rate" KPI focuses on critical metrics, adhering to best practices. [cite: 98]

### Dashboard Construction Steps (Power BI):
1.  [cite_start]Open Power BI Desktop. [cite: 101]
2.  [cite_start]Import data from Excel workbooks. [cite: 102, 103]
3.  [cite_start]Transform data: [cite: 105]
    * [cite_start]Remove blank rows from "Country Grouping" file. [cite: 106, 107]
    * [cite_start]Replace null values in columns with "unclassified". [cite: 108]
    * [cite_start]Replace header names if inappropriate. [cite: 109]
    * [cite_start]Change the 'Time' column type from decimal to date type in the main file. [cite: 110]
4.  [cite_start]Load data into Power BI. [cite: 111]
5.  [cite_start]Establish relationships between tables (e.g., 'Time Code' between files, 'Country Code' for grouping). [cite: 112, 113]
6.  Create new measures:
    * [cite_start]**Total Population:** Sum of female and male populations. [cite: 114, 115, 116]
    * [cite_start]**Natural Increase Rate:** Birth rate minus death rate. [cite: 117, 118]
7.  Build Visualizations:
    * **Line and Stacked Column Chart:** Drag to canvas, add 'Country Name' to X-axis, 'Sum of Urban Population', 'Sum of Rural Population', and 'Sum of Total Population' to Column Y-axis. Drag 'Average of Total Population' to Line Y-axis. Apply "Top N" filter for top 5 countries by 'Sum of Total Population'. [cite_start]Sort axis by 'Sum of Total Population'. [cite: 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126]
    * **Filled Map:** Drag to canvas, add 'Country Name' to 'Location'. Format fill colors using a gradient based on 'Average of Life expectancy at birth', setting minimum, center, and maximum colors. [cite_start]Add 'Average of Life expectancy at birth' to tooltips. [cite: 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133]
    * [cite_start]**Stacked Area Chart:** Drag to canvas, add 'Time (Year)' to X-axis, and 'Average of Urban Population', 'Average of Rural Population' to Y-axis. [cite: 135, 136, 137]
    * [cite_start]**Card:** Drag to canvas, select 'Natural Increase Rate'. [cite: 138, 139]
    * **Multiple Line Chart:** Drag to canvas, add 'Time (Years)' to X-axis, 'Average of Death Rate' and 'Average of Birth Rate' to Y-axis. [cite_start]Add 'Average of Annual Population Growth' to secondary Y-axis. [cite: 140, 141, 142, 143]
